## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account

1. Go to [SendGrid Sign Up](https://signup.sendgrid.com/)
2. Fill in your details:
   - Email: Your email address
   - Password: Create a secure password
   - Complete the sign-up form

3. **Verify your email address** (check your inbox)

### Step 2: Complete Account Setup

After email verification, SendGrid will ask some questions:
- **Are you a developer?** Yes
- **What are you building?** Learning Management System
- **Choose your plan:** Free (100 emails/day)

### Step 3: Verify Sender Identity

**IMPORTANT:** SendGrid requires sender verification for security.

#### Option A: Single Sender Verification (Easiest - 2 minutes)

1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **From Name:** LMS Admin
   - **From Email Address:** nikhilthapa1414@gmail.com (or your email)
   - **Reply To:** Same as above
   - **Company Address:** Your address
   - **Nickname:** LMS Notifications

4. Click **Create**
5. **Check your email** for verification link
6. Click the verification link

✅ **Done!** You can now send emails from this address.

#### Option B: Domain Authentication (Advanced - 15 minutes)

Only needed if you have a custom domain (e.g., yourdomain.com).

### Step 4: Create API Key

1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give it a name: `LMS_Development`
4. Choose **Full Access** (for simplicity)
5. Click **Create & View**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Copy the API key NOW! You won't see it again.

Example API key format: `SG.aBc123XyZ...` (about 69 characters)

### Step 5: Configure Your Application

1. Open `/server/.env`
2. Update these values:

```env
# Email Service Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid

# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=nikhilthapa1414@gmail.com
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** 
- Replace `SG.your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual API key
- Use the EXACT email address you verified in Step 3
- No quotes needed around the values

### Step 6: Restart Your Server

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Step 7: Test Email Sending

1. Login as admin: `admin@lms.com` / `admin123`
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "Invite Teacher"
4. Fill in details and submit

✅ **Check the server console** for success message:
```
✅ SendGrid email sent successfully to teacher@example.com
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Forbidden"

**Cause:** API key is invalid or not configured

**Fix:**
1. Verify your API key in `.env` starts with `SG.`
2. Make sure you copied the entire key
3. Restart the server after updating `.env`

### Error: "The from email does not match a verified Sender Identity"

**Cause:** The email in `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` wasn't verified

**Fix:**
1. Go to Settings → Sender Authentication
2. Verify the email you want to use
3. Update `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` in `.env` to match the verified email
4. Restart server

### Error: "Daily limit exceeded"

**Cause:** You've sent 100+ emails today (free tier limit)

**Fix:**
- Wait until tomorrow for limit reset
- Or upgrade to a paid plan for higher limits

### Email Not Received

**Check:**
1. **Spam folder** - SendGrid emails may go to spam initially
2. **Server logs** - Look for success/error messages
3. **SendGrid Activity** - Go to Activity in dashboard to see delivery status

## 📊 Monitoring Emails

### View Email Activity

1. Go to SendGrid dashboard
2. Click **Activity** in sidebar

## 🔄 Switching Back to Gmail (if needed)

If you want to use Gmail again later:
