---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No active teachers available"
**Solution**: 
- Admin must first invite teachers
- Teachers must complete registration
- Teachers must be marked as active

### Issue: Teacher still sees "Create Course"
**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete / Cmd+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Verify frontend code is updated

### Issue: 403 Forbidden when admin creates course
**Solution**:
- Verify user is logged in as admin
- Check JWT token is valid
- Ensure using `/api/admin/courses` endpoint (not `/api/courses`)

### Issue: Course code validation fails
**Solution**:
- Use 3-20 characters
- Only uppercase letters, numbers, hyphens
- Examples: CS-101, MATH-201, ENG-101A
