# üì± Accessing LMS from Your Phone

## The Problem

The invitation link has `localhost` which only works on the same computer:
```
‚ùå http://localhost:5173/register/teacher/...
```

When you open this on your **phone**, it tries to connect to your **phone's localhost** (which doesn't exist), not your **Mac's localhost**.

**Error:** `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` ‚úã

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Test on Your Mac (Quick Test)

**Best for:** Quick testing, development

1. Open your email **on your Mac** (not phone)
2. Click the invitation link
3. It will open in your Mac's browser
4. Complete the registration

**This works immediately!** No configuration needed.

---

## üåê Solution 2: Access from Phone (Production-like)

**Best for:** Testing on mobile devices, sharing with others on same network

### Your Mac's IP Address: `192.168.1.13`

### Step-by-Step Setup:

#### 1. Update Server Configuration

Edit `/Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms/server/.env`:

**Change this line:**
```env
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**To this:**
```env
CLIENT_URL=http://192.168.1.13:5173
```

#### 2. Update Vite Configuration

Edit `/Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms/client/vite.config.js`:

**Add this configuration:**
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',  // Listen on all network interfaces
    port: 5173
  }
})
```

#### 3. Update Backend to Accept External Connections

Edit `/Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms/server/src/app.js`:

**Find this line:**
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '127.0.0.1', () => {
```

**Change to:**
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
```

#### 4. Restart Servers

```bash
# Stop current servers (Ctrl+C)
cd /Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Send New Invitation

1. Login as admin: http://192.168.1.13:5173
   - Email: admin@lms.com
   - Password: admin123

2. Go to Admin Dashboard

3. Send new teacher invitation

4. The email will now have:
   ```
   ‚úÖ http://192.168.1.13:5173/register/teacher/...
   ```

#### 6. Open on Phone

1. Make sure your phone is on **the same WiFi** as your Mac
2. Open the email on your phone
3. Click the link
4. It should work! üéâ

## üîç Verification

### Test if your phone can reach your Mac:

**On your phone's browser, visit:**
- Frontend: http://192.168.1.13:5173
- Should see the LMS login page ‚úÖ

**If you get "Connection Refused":**
- Check WiFi: Phone and Mac on same network?
- Check Firewall: Mac firewall blocking connections?
- Check servers: Are they running with `0.0.0.0` host?

---

## üî• Firewall Settings (If Needed)

If your Mac's firewall is blocking connections:

1. Open **System Settings** ‚Üí **Network** ‚Üí **Firewall**
2. Click **Options**
3. Make sure "Block all incoming connections" is **OFF**
4. Or add exception for Node

---

## üìù Quick Commands

### Get Your IP Address
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

### Test Backend from Phone
```bash
# On your Mac, check if listening on all interfaces
lsof -iTCP:5000 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

### Test Frontend from Phone  
```bash
# On your Mac
lsof -iTCP:5173 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

---

## üéØ Current Setup Status

**Your Mac's IP:** `192.168.1.13`

**Current Configuration:**
- CLIENT_URL: `http://localhost:5173` (needs update for phone access)
- Backend: Listening on `127.0.0.1` (needs update to `0.0.0.0`)
- Frontend: Listening on `localhost` (needs update to `0.0.0.0`)

**To enable phone access:**
- [ ] Update CLIENT_URL in .env
- [ ] Update Vite config to listen on 0.0.0.0
- [ ] Update app.js to listen on 0.0.0.0
- [ ] Restart servers
- [ ] Send new invitation
- [ ] Test from phone

## üí° Important Notes

### About localhost vs IP Address

**localhost (127.0.0.1):**
- Only accessible from the same computer
- Perfect for development
- More secure (can't be accessed externally)

**IP Address (192.168.1.13):**
- Accessible from other devices on same network
- Good for testing on multiple devices
- Less secure (anyone on your WiFi can access)

### Security Warning

When using IP address:
- Only use on trusted WiFi networks
- Don't use on public WiFi
- Your LMS will be accessible to anyone on the network
- This is fine for development/testing
- For production, use proper domain with HTTPS

### IP Address May Change

Your Mac's IP (`192.168.1.13`) may change if:
- You restart your router
- You reconnect to WiFi
- Your router assigns a new IP

**If IP changes:**
1. Run `bash get-ip.sh` to get new IP
2. Update .env with new IP
3. Restart servers
4. Send new invitations

## üöÄ Recommended Workflow

### For Development on Mac Only:
```env
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
- Servers listen on `127.0.0.1`
- Only accessible on your Mac
- More secure ‚úÖ

### For Testing on Phone:
```env
CLIENT_URL=http://192.168.1.13:5173
```
- Servers listen on `0.0.0.0`
- Accessible from any device on WiFi
- Good for mobile testing ‚úÖ

### For Production:
```env
CLIENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```
- Use proper domain with HTTPS
- Deploy to cloud server
- Most secure ‚úÖ

2. Update servers to listen on `0.0.0.0`
3. Restart servers
4. Send new invitation
5. Link will work on phone!

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Email system working (nik224134@gmail.com)
