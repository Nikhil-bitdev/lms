# üîó Invitation Link Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Email Sent Successfully!

Great news - the email is being sent! From the server logs:
```
‚úÖ Email sent: <9219e64e-d7db-bd62-580a-2d4b7daa70df@gmail.com>
```

---

## üîç Debugging the Link Issue

### Step 1: Check the Link in Your Email

The link should look like this:
```
http://localhost:5173/register/teacher/[64-character-token]
```

Example:
```
http://localhost:5173/register/teacher/a1b2c3d4e5f6789...
```

**‚ùì Questions:**
1. Does your link match this format?
2. Does it say `localhost:5173`?
3. Is there a long token after `/teacher/`?

---

### Step 2: Check What's Running

**Both servers MUST be running:**

‚úÖ Backend: http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000
‚úÖ Frontend: http://localhost:5173

**Current Status:**
- Backend: ‚úÖ Running (port 5000)
- Frontend: ‚úÖ Running (port 5173)

---

### Step 3: Test the Link Manually

#### Test 1: Visit Frontend
Open: http://localhost:5173

**Expected:** You should see the LMS login page

**If you get "Connection refused":**
- Frontend is not running
- Run: `npm run dev` from `/Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms`

#### Test 2: Copy the Exact Link from Email

1. Open the email
2. **Right-click** on the "Complete Registration" button
3. Select "Copy link address" 
4. **Paste it here in a text editor** to see the exact URL
5. Then paste it in your browser

**What error do you see?**

---

### Step 4: Common Issues and Fixes

#### Issue 1: "Cannot GET /register/teacher/..."

**Symptoms:** Page shows "Cannot GET" or 404

**Cause:** Frontend route not found

**Fix:** Make sure you're visiting the frontend URL (localhost:5173), not the backend (localhost:5000)

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Wrong: `http://localhost:5000/register/teacher/abc123`
- ‚úÖ Right: `http://localhost:5173/register/teacher/abc123`

---

#### Issue 2: "Invalid or expired invitation"

**Symptoms:** Page loads but shows error message

**Cause:** 
- Token doesn't exist in database
- Token already used
- Token expired (7 days)

**Fix:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Send a new invitation
3. Use the NEW link (old ones won't work)

---

#### Issue 3: Blank Page or Loading Forever

**Symptoms:** Page loads but stays blank or shows loading spinner

**Cause:** Frontend can't connect to backend API

**Check:**
1. Is backend running? (should show in terminal)
2. Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
3. Look for CORS errors or network errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart both servers
cd /Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms
npm run dev
```

---

#### Issue 4: Link Opens but Shows Different Page

**Symptoms:** Link opens but redirects somewhere else

**Cause:** 
- Protected route redirecting if you're already logged in
- Browser cached old page

**Fix:**
1. Open link in **incognito/private window**
2. Or log out first, then click link
3. Clear browser cache

---

### Step 5: Test the API Directly

Let's verify the backend is working:

#### Test Backend Route:

```bash
# Get invitation details (replace TOKEN with actual token from email)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register/teacher/TOKEN
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-25T..."
}
```

**If you get 400 error:**
```json
{
  "message": "Invalid or expired invitation token"
}
```
This means the token is wrong or expired - send a new invitation.

---

### Step 6: Check Browser Console

1. Click the invitation link
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for any red errors

**Common errors:**

**Error: "Failed to fetch"**
- Backend is not running
- Wrong API URL
- CORS issue

**Error: "404 Not Found"**
- Route doesn't exist
- Frontend not running

**Error: "Network Error"**
- Backend not responding
- Firewall blocking connection

---

### Step 7: Verify Link Generation

Let's check if the link is being generated correctly:

```bash
cd /Users/nikhil/Desktop/lms/server
node -e "console.log('Link will be:', process.env.CLIENT_URL || 'http://localhost:5173')"
```

**Should show:**
```
Link will be: http://localhost:5173
```

---
