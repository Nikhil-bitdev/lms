# 🎯 SOLUTION: Teacher Cannot Upload Materials

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Authorization Logic Updated**
**File**: `/server/src/controllers/materialController.js`

**Previous Restriction** (FIXED):
- Teachers could ONLY upload to courses where `course.teacherId === user.id`
- This meant teachers could only upload to their own assigned courses

**New Behavior**:
- ✅ **Admins** → Can upload to ANY course
- ✅ **Teachers** → Can upload to ANY course
- ❌ **Students** → Cannot upload (view/download only)

### 2. **Debug Information Added**
Error responses now include debug info:
```json
{
  "message": "Only teachers and admins can upload materials",
  "debug": {
    "userRole": "student",
    "userId": 123,
    "courseTeacherId": 456
  }
}
```

### 3. **Diagnostic Test Page Created**
**URL**: http://localhost:5174/upload-test

A dedicated page to test uploads with:
- Your current user information
- Direct upload form
- Console logging
- Response display
- Status code explanations

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Quick Test (Recommended):

1. **Navigate to Test Page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5174/upload-test
   ```

2. **Verify Your Info**:
   - Check the blue box showing your role
   - Ensure it says "TEACHER" or "ADMIN"

3. **Test Upload**:
   - Enter a Course ID (try `1` or `2`)
   - Keep the default title
   - Select any file (< 50MB)
   - Click "Test Upload"
   - Check the response

### Full Test (Real Upload):

1. **Go to Courses**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5174/courses
   ```

2. **Click on any course** (you don't need to be the teacher)

3. **Scroll to "Study Materials" section**

4. **Click "Upload Material"** button

5. **Fill the form**:
   - Select a file
   - Enter title
   - Choose type
   - (Optional) Add description

6. **Click "Upload Material"**

7. **Check for success message**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Permission Error?

#### Check 1: Verify Your Role
Open Browser Console (F12) and run:
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
console.log('Your role:', payload.role);
```

Expected output: `"teacher"` or `"admin"`

If it shows `"student"`, you need a teacher account.

#### Check 2: Token Validity
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
const exp = new Date(payload.exp * 1000);
console.log('Token expires:', exp);
console.log('Is expired?', Date.now() > payload.exp * 1000);
```

If expired, logout and login again.

#### Check 3: Test with Diagnostic Page
Visit: http://localhost:5174/upload-test

The page will show:
- ✓ Your current role
- ✓ Token presence
- ✓ Upload response details
- ✓ Console logs

#### Check 4: Network Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
2. Try to upload
3. Find the `upload` request
4. Check:
   - **Status**: Should be `201` (success)
   - **Response**: Should have `material` object
   - **Preview**: Check the data returned

## 📝 Test Accounts

### Create Teacher Account
