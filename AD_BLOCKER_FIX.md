# üö´ ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT - Fixed!

## The Problem

**Error:** `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`

**Cause:** Browser extension (ad blocker, privacy extension, etc.) is blocking the API requests to localhost:5000

**Additional Issue:** Frontend was hardcoded to use `localhost:5000` instead of the IP address, so it wouldn't work on your phone anyway.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Frontend API URL

**Before:**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

**After:**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.13:5000/api
```

### 2. Fixed TeacherRegisterPage

Changed hardcoded `localhost:5000` URLs to use the environment variable, so it works on both Mac and phone.
