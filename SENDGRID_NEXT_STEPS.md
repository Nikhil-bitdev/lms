- Added `SENDGRID_API_KEY` variable
- Added `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` variable
- System keeps Gmail config as backup

Follow these simple steps to complete the setup:

### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com/

3. Verify your email address (check inbox)

### Step 2: Verify Sender Email (2 minutes)

1. Login to SendGrid
2. Go to **Settings** → **Sender Authentication**
3. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**
4. Fill in:
   - From Name: `LMS Admin`
   - From Email: `nikhilthapa1414@gmail.com` (or your preferred email)
   - Reply To: Same as above
   - Fill in address fields (any address works for testing)
5. Click **Create**
6. **Check your email** for verification link
7. Click the verification link

### Step 3: Create API Key (1 minute)

1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name: `LMS_Development`
4. Permission: **Full Access**
5. Click **"Create & View"**
6. **COPY THE KEY NOW** - you won't see it again!

The key looks like: `SG.aBc123XyZ...` (about 69 characters)

### Step 4: Update Your .env File

1. Open `/server/.env`
2. Find these lines:
   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=nikhilthapa1414@gmail.com
   ```

   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_from_step3
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=nikhilthapa1414@gmail.com
   ```
   (Use the EXACT email you verified in Step 2)

### Step 5: Test Configuration

```bash
cd server
node test-sendgrid.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ Test email sent successfully!
📬 Check your inbox: nikhilthapa1414@gmail.com
