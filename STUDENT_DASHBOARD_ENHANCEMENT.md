## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### Modified Files:

**1. `/client/src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`**

**Added State:**
```javascript
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [dashboardData, setDashboardData] = useState({
  courses: [],
  assignments: [],
  coursesCount: 0,
  pendingAssignments: 0,
  upcomingQuizzes: 0
});
```

**Added Data Fetching:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    fetchDashboardData();
  }
}, [user]);

const fetchDashboardData = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const [coursesResponse, assignmentsResponse] = await Promise.all([
      courseService.getMyCourses(),
      assignmentService.getUserAssignments()
    ]);
    // Process and set data...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching dashboard data:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

**Key Features:**
- Parallel API calls for better performance
- Calculates pending assignments by comparing due dates
- Filters out completed assignments
- Role-based UI rendering
- Responsive design

### Backend Changes

**2. `/server/src/controllers/assignmentController.js`**

**Enhanced `getUserAssignments` function:**

```javascript
const getUserAssignments = async (req, res) => {
  // For students:
  // 1. Get enrolled courses via Enrollment model
  // 2. Fetch assignments only from enrolled courses
  // 3. Include submission status for each assignment
  // 4. Add isSubmitted flag for easier frontend handling
  
  // For teachers:
  // - Get all assignments from courses they teach
};
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Proper filtering for student enrollments
- Includes submission status
- Adds `isSubmitted` flag to response
- Returns course details with each assignment
- Properly ordered by due date
