## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 768px)
- **1 column grid**
- Cards stack vertically
- Full width cards
- Easy tap targets

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- **2 column grid**
- Side-by-side layout
- Balanced spacing

### Desktop (>1024px)
- **3 column grid**
- Optimal viewing
- Maximum information density

## Dark Mode Support

### Light Mode

- Gray-200 border
- Purple-400 hover border
- Gray-900 text

### Dark Mode  
- Gray-800 to gray-900 gradient background

## Icons Used
From `@heroicons/react/24/outline`:
- **AcademicCapIcon** - Course badge
- **UserGroupIcon** - Teacher indicator
- **ClipboardDocumentListIcon** - Assignments icon
- **ClockIcon** - Due soon indicator
- **Arrow SVG** - Navigation indicator

## Conditional Rendering

### Shows When:
- ✅ User role is 'student'
- ✅ Student has at least 1 enrolled course
- ✅ Dashboard data loaded successfully

### Hidden When:
- ❌ User is teacher or admin
- ❌ Student has no courses
- ❌ Data is still loading

## Pending Assignment Logic

```javascript
// Only count assignments that are:
const courseAssignments = dashboardData.assignments.filter(
  assignment => 
    assignment.courseId === course.id &&    // Belongs to this course
    !assignment.submitted &&                 // Not yet submitted
    new Date(assignment.dueDate) > new Date() // Due in the future
);

const pendingCount = courseAssignments.length;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
- **Conditional Rendering** - Section only renders for students with courses
- **Efficient Filtering** - Single pass through assignments array per course
- **CSS Transitions** - Hardware-accelerated transforms
- **Lazy Calculations** - Pending count calculated only when rendering

### Potential Improvements:
- **Memoization** - useMemo for course filtering
- **Virtual Scrolling** - For students with many courses (>20)
- **Skeleton Loading** - Show placeholders while data loads
- **Pagination** - If course count exceeds 12

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- ✅ Focusable buttons
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML
- ✅ Clear focus states

### Screen Readers
- ✅ Descriptive button elements
- ✅ Meaningful text content
- ✅ Icon labels implied by surrounding text

### Color Contrast
- ✅ WCAG AA compliant text contrast
- ✅ Multiple visual indicators (not just color)
- ✅ Dark mode tested for contrast
