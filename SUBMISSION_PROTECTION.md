# Assignment Submission Protection

## Overview
Prevents students from submitting the same assignment multiple times to maintain data integrity and prevent accidental duplicate submissions.

## Implementation

### Backend Protection (assignmentController.js)

**Validation Added:**
- Checks if student has already submitted before creating new submission
- Returns 400 error with `ALREADY_SUBMITTED` error code if duplicate detected
- Database query: `Submission.findOne({ where: { assignmentId, userId } })`

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "You have already submitted this assignment. Multiple submissions are not allowed.",
  "error": "ALREADY_SUBMITTED"
}
```

### Frontend Protection (AssignmentDetails.jsx)

**1. UI State Management:**
- Submit form is hidden when `assignment.submitted === true`
- Replaced with "Assignment Submitted" success message
- Shows submission timestamp
- Displays grade if assignment has been graded

**2. Form Validation:**
- Pre-submit check: Verifies `assignment.submitted` flag before allowing submission
- Shows error toast if already submitted

**3. Error Handling:**
- Catches `ALREADY_SUBMITTED` error from backend
- Shows user-friendly error message
- Automatically refreshes assignment data to show submitted state

## User Experience

### Before Submission:
- ✅ Students see file upload form
- ✅ Can drag & drop files
- ✅ Submit button is enabled

### After Submission:
- 🎉 **Success message displayed:**
  - Green checkmark icon
  - "Assignment Submitted" heading
  - Submission timestamp
  - Grade display (if graded)
- 🚫 **Submit form is hidden**
- 🔒 **Cannot submit again**

### Visual States:

**Already Submitted Message:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓  Assignment Submitted            │
│                                     │
│  You have successfully submitted    │
│  this assignment.                   │
│                                     │
│  🕐 Submitted on: Oct 22, 2025     │
│                                     │
│  ⭐ Your Grade: 85/100              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Security Features

1. **Backend Validation:** Primary protection at API level
2. **Frontend Validation:** UX improvement to prevent unnecessary API calls
3. **Database Constraint:** Uses userId + assignmentId combination check
4. **Error Code System:** Specific error codes for different scenarios

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Student refreshes page after submission** - Shows submitted state
✅ **Student tries to submit via API directly** - Backend blocks it
✅ **Race condition (rapid clicks)** - Backend checks prevent duplicates
✅ **Network issues during submission** - Error handling with retry option
✅ **Teacher grades submission** - Grade displays in submitted message
