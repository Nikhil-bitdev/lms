## Implementation Details

### Backend

#### Controller (`/server/src/controllers/adminController.js`)

**New Function: `deleteTeacher`**
```javascript
const deleteTeacher = async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Find teacher by ID
  // 2. Check if teacher has any courses assigned
  // 3. If courses exist, return error with count
  // 4. Delete teacher account
  // 5. Return success response
}
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Teacher must exist
- Teacher role must be 'teacher'
- Teacher must have 0 courses assigned
- Returns course count if deletion blocked

#### Routes (`/server/src/routes/adminRoutes.js`)

**New Route:**
```javascript
DELETE /api/admin/teachers/:id
```

**Authorization:**
- Requires authentication (JWT token)
- Requires admin role
- Uses existing auth and authorize middleware

### Frontend

#### Admin Dashboard (`/client/src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.jsx`)

**New State:**
```javascript
const [confirmDialog, setConfirmDialog] = useState({
  isOpen: false,
  teacherId: null,
  teacherName: ''
});
```

**New Functions:**

1. **`handleDeleteTeacher(teacherId, teacherName)`**
   - Opens confirmation dialog
   - Stores teacher ID and name for display

2. **`confirmDeleteTeacher()`**
   - Makes DELETE API request
   - Handles success/error responses
   - Refreshes teacher list
   - Shows toast notifications

**UI Changes:**
- Added "Delete" button next to Activate/Deactivate
- Changed Deactivate button color to orange (from red)
- Added spacing between action buttons
- Integrated ConfirmDialog component

**ConfirmDialog Integration:**
```jsx
<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={confirmDialog.isOpen}
  onClose={() => setConfirmDialog({ isOpen: false, teacherId: null, teacherName: '' })}
  onConfirm={confirmDeleteTeacher}
  title="Delete Teacher"
  message={`Are you sure you want to delete "${confirmDialog.teacherName}"?\n\nThis action cannot be undone. The teacher must not have any courses assigned to them.`}
  confirmText="Delete Teacher"
  cancelText="Cancel"
  type="danger"
/>
```

## User Flow

### Successful Deletion
1. Admin views teacher list in Admin Dashboard
2. Admin clicks "Delete" button next to teacher name
3. Beautiful confirmation modal appears with:
   - Red danger icon
   - Teacher's name
   - Warning about permanence
   - Note about course requirement
4. Admin clicks "Delete Teacher" to confirm
5. Modal closes
6. Success toast appears: "Teacher deleted successfully"
7. Teacher list refreshes automatically
8. Deleted teacher is removed from list

### Blocked Deletion (Teacher has courses)
1. Admin clicks "Delete" on teacher with courses
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. Admin clicks "Delete Teacher"
4. Error toast appears: "Cannot delete teacher. They have X course(s) assigned. Please reassign or delete the courses first."
5. Teacher remains in system
6. Admin must reassign/delete courses first

## Error Scenarios

### Frontend Errors
- **Network error**: "Failed to delete teacher"
- **Server error**: Displays error message from backend
- **Validation error**: Shows specific error (e.g., course count)

### Backend Errors
- **404**: "Teacher not found" - Invalid teacher ID
- **400**: "Cannot delete teacher. They have X course(s) assigned. Please reassign or delete the courses first."
- **500**: "Error deleting teacher" - Database or server error

## API Specification

### Delete Teacher Endpoint

**Request:**
```http
DELETE /api/admin/teachers/:id
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "message": "Teacher deleted successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

**Error Response - Has Courses (400):**
```json
{
  "message": "Cannot delete teacher. They have 3 course(s) assigned. Please reassign or delete the courses first.",
  "coursesCount": 3
}
```

**Error Response - Not Found (404):**
```json
{
  "message": "Teacher not found"
}
```

**Error Response - Server Error (500):**
```json
{
  "message": "Error deleting teacher"
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization Layers
1. **Route-level**: Admin routes require auth + admin role
2. **Controller-level**: Verifies teacher role before deletion
3. **Business logic**: Checks course assignments before allowing deletion

### Data Integrity
- Cascade deletion not implemented (intentional)
- Prevents orphaned courses
- Requires manual course reassignment/deletion
- Maintains referential integrity

### Documentation
1. `/DELETE_TEACHER_FEATURE.md` (this file)

## Comparison with Delete Assignment

Both features use similar patterns:

| Feature | Delete Assignment | Delete Teacher |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Confirmation** | ‚úÖ ConfirmDialog | ‚úÖ ConfirmDialog |
| **Route Ordering** | Fixed (specific before generic) | N/A (no conflict) |
| **Cascade** | ‚úÖ Deletes submissions & files | ‚ùå Blocks if courses exist |
| **Authorization** | Admin + Teacher (own) | Admin only |
| **UI Location** | Dashboard & All Assignments | Admin Dashboard |
| **Error Handling** | Toast notifications | Toast notifications |

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Bulk deletion**: Select multiple teachers to delete at once
2. **Cascade option**: Optionally delete or reassign teacher's courses
3. **Soft delete**: Archive teachers instead of permanent deletion
4. **Activity log**: Track who deleted which teacher and when
5. **Undo feature**: Restore recently deleted teachers
6. **Export data**: Download teacher data before deletion
7. **Transfer wizard**: UI to reassign courses before deletion

### Database Considerations
```sql
-- Potential soft delete approach
ALTER TABLE Users ADD COLUMN deletedAt DATETIME NULL;
ALTER TABLE Users ADD COLUMN deletedBy INTEGER NULL;

-- Query active teachers
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE role = 'teacher' AND deletedAt IS NULL;

-- Restore deleted teacher
UPDATE Users SET deletedAt = NULL WHERE id = ?;
```
