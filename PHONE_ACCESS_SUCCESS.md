## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Connection Refused" on Phone

**Solution 1: Check WiFi**
- Make sure phone is on **the same WiFi** as your Mac
- Not on cellular data!

**Solution 2: Check Firewall**
```bash
# On your Mac, check firewall status
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
```

If firewall is ON, allow Node:
- System Settings → Network → Firewall → Options
- Make sure "Block all incoming connections" is OFF

**Solution 3: Verify Servers Running**
Check terminal - should show:
```
Server is running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
➜  Network: http://192.168.1.13:5173/
```

---

### Problem: Page Loads but Can't Login

**Likely Cause:** Backend not accessible

**Test Backend:**
On your phone's browser, go to:
```
http://192.168.1.13:5000/api/health
```

**Should return:**
```json
{"status":"ok","time":"..."}
```

**If it fails:** Backend firewall issue or not running

**Solution:** 
Send a **NEW** invitation after the configuration changes.
