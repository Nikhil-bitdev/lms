## 🔐 Login Issue Resolution

The issue has been **fixed**! Here's what was wrong and how it's resolved:

### ❌ **The Problem:**
The test users were created with **double-hashed passwords**. The `create-test-user.js` script was manually hashing the password with `bcrypt.hash()`, but then the User model's `beforeCreate` hook was hashing it again, resulting in a hash of a hash.

### ✅ **The Solution:**
I've updated the user creation script to let the User model handle password hashing automatically.

### 🎯 **Current Status:**
