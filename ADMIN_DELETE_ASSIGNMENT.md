# Admin Delete Assignment Feature

## Overview
Admins can now delete assignments from the dashboard and assignments page. This feature includes proper authorization, cascading deletion of submissions, and file cleanup.

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Server)

**1. Controller** (`/server/src/controllers/assignmentController.js`)
- Added `deleteAssignment` function
- **Authorization:**
  - Admin: Can delete any assignment
  - Teacher: Can delete their own course assignments
- **Deletion Process:**
  1. Validates assignment exists
  2. Checks user authorization
  3. Deletes all associated submissions
  4. Deletes associated files from uploads folder
  5. Deletes the assignment record

**2. Routes** (`/server/src/routes/assignmentRoutes.js`)
```javascript
router.delete('/:id', auth, authorize('admin', 'teacher'), assignmentController.deleteAssignment);
```

**3. Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Assignment deleted successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

### Frontend (Client)

**1. Service** (`/client/src/services/assignmentService.js`)
```javascript
deleteAssignment: async (assignmentId) => {
  const response = await api.delete(`/assignments/${assignmentId}`);
  return response.data;
}
```

**2. Dashboard** (`/client/src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`)
- Added delete button next to "View" button (admin only)
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Displays loading spinner during deletion
- Auto-refreshes assignment list after deletion
- Toast notifications for success/error

**3. All Assignments Page** (`/client/src/pages/AllAssignmentsPage.jsx`)
- Added delete button after "Submissions" button (admin only)
- Same confirmation and loading behavior
- Consistent UI with dashboard

## User Interface

### Delete Button Design:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [View] [Delete]                    │  (Admin Dashboard)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [View Details] [Submissions] [Delete] │  (All Assignments)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Button States:**
- **Normal:** Red background, white text, trash icon
- **Hover:** Darker red, shadow effect, scale animation
- **Loading:** Gray background, spinning icon, "Deleting..." text
- **Disabled:** Light gray, cursor not-allowed

### Confirmation Dialog:
```
Are you sure you want to delete "[Assignment Title]"?
This action cannot be undone and will delete all student submissions.

[Cancel] [OK]
```
