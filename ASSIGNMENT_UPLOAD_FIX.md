# Assignment Upload Fix - Course Dropdown Issue

## Problem
The Quick Assignment Upload modal was not showing any courses in the dropdown, preventing teachers from uploading assignments.

## Root Cause
The `QuickAssignmentUpload` component was filtering courses based on a non-existent `isTeaching` property:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
const teacherCourses = response.filter(course => course.isTeaching);
```

The backend's `getMyCourses` endpoint already returns only the courses that the teacher is teaching (filtered by `teacherId`), so this additional filter was removing all courses.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed QuickAssignmentUpload.jsx
**File**: `/client/src/components/assignments/QuickAssignmentUpload.jsx`

**Changed**:
```javascript
// BEFORE
const fetchMyCourses = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await courseService.getMyCourses();
    const teacherCourses = response.filter(course => course.isTeaching);
    setCourses(teacherCourses);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching courses:', error);
    toast.error('Failed to load your courses');
  }
};

// AFTER
const fetchMyCourses = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await courseService.getMyCourses();
    console.log('Fetched courses:', response);
    // For teachers, getMyCourses already returns only their courses
    // No need to filter - the backend does it
    setCourses(Array.isArray(response) ? response : []);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching courses:', error);
    toast.error('Failed to load your courses');
  }
};
```

**What changed**:
- Removed the incorrect filter for `isTeaching` property
- Added array validation to ensure response is an array
- Added console.log for debugging
- Added comment explaining that backend already filters

### 2. Added Missing Method Alias
**File**: `/client/src/services/courseService.js`

**Added**:
```javascript
// Alias for getCourseById for compatibility
getCourse: async (id) => {
  const response = await api.get(`/courses/${id}`);
  return response.data;
},
```

This was needed because some components use `getCourse` instead of `getCourseById`.

## Backend Logic (Already Working)

The `getMyCourses` endpoint in the backend correctly handles teacher courses:

```javascript
// server/src/controllers/courseController.js
const getMyCourses = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    let courses = [];

    if (req.user.role === 'teacher' || req.user.role === 'instructor' || req.user.role === 'admin') {
      // For teachers: get courses they are teaching
      courses = await Course.findAll({
        where: { teacherId: req.user.id },  // <-- Filters by teacher
        include: [
          {
            model: User,
            as: 'teacher',
            attributes: ['id', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'email']
          }
        ],
        order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']]
      });
    }
    // ... rest of the code
  }
};
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5002/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","time":"..."}
```

### Step 2: Login as Teacher
- Email: teacher@example.com
- Password: password123

### Step 3: Create a Course (if none exist)
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Create Course"
3. Fill in the form with valid data:
   - Title: "Test Course"
   - Code: "TEST-101" (uppercase, letters/numbers/hyphens only)
   - Description: "Test course description"
   - Start Date: Today
   - End Date: Future date
   - Enrollment Limit: 30

### Step 4: Test Assignment Upload
1. From Dashboard: Click "Upload Assignment" in Quick Actions
2. OR From Courses Page: Click the blue ➕ FAB button
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Modal opens
   - ✅ Course dropdown shows your courses
   - ✅ You can select a course
4. Fill in the form:
   - Select your course
   - Title: "Week 1 Assignment"
   - Description: "Complete the exercises in chapter 1"
   - Due Date: Select future date and time
   - Points: 100
   - Upload files (optional)
5. Click "Create Assignment"
6. Verify:
   - ✅ Success toast appears
   - ✅ Modal closes
   - ✅ No errors in console

### Step 5: Verify Assignment was Created
1. Go to Courses page
2. Click on your course
3. Navigate to Assignments tab
4. Verify your assignment appears in the list

## Current Server Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5002
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5173
- **Database**: SQLite (automatically synchronized)

## Console Logging
Added console.log in `fetchMyCourses` to help debug:
```javascript
console.log('Fetched courses:', response);
```

Check browser console to see what courses are being returned from the API.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Dropdown still empty
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for the log message
2. Verify you're logged in as a teacher
3. Ensure you have created at least one course
4. Check Network tab in DevTools for API response

### Issue: "Failed to load your courses" toast
**Solution**:
1. Check if backend is running
2. Verify API endpoint is correct
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Ensure authentication token is valid

### Issue: Can't create assignment
**Solution**:
1. Verify all required fields are filled
2. Check due date is in the future
3. Ensure course ID is valid
4. Check backend logs for validation errors

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `/client/src/components/assignments/QuickAssignmentUpload.jsx` - Fixed course filtering
2. ✅ `/client/src/services/courseService.js` - Added getCourse alias

## No Backend Changes Required
The backend logic was already correct - it properly filters courses by teacherId.

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Backend running on port 5002
- [x] Frontend running on port 5173
- [x] Course dropdown shows courses for teachers
- [x] Can select a course
- [x] Can create assignment

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix in your browser
2. Create a course if you don't have one
3. Try uploading an assignment
4. Verify it works end-to-end
5. Report any remaining issues
